title: MEE6 - The Tyrant of Discord Bots
---

If you've used Discord for over an hour, you surely know of MEE6's existents. MEE6 is the largest Discord bot *(since the recent abatement of Groovy and Rythm)*, used for managing Discord servers.\
Recently, the MEE6 team has hired new employees and redesigned their whole website and UX. These are some great changes, and it seems the bot is going in the right direction, isn't it? Well, as cliche as it sounds; it was good until it was not.\
Let me explain the reality of these new MEE6 instigations, and how MEE6 is becoming more tyrannical by the day.

### Background
On March 15th 2016, MEE6 was created by a programmer named Anis (also known as 'Cookie'). Anis had made a premature version of the bot in just 3 days. It quickly grew in popularity because of a variety of useful features, like social notifications, leveling, welcoming, and more.

### Monopoly
MEE6 has become a monopoly due to its heavy cornerstone on user-friendliness. This is something we can all learn from as bot developersâ€”prioritize user-friendliness over a complex structure.\
However, MEE6 takes its user-friendliness to the extreme. The dashboard is made in a way that anyone with half a brain cell could use it. The apparent focus on user-friendliness also shows in the fact that up until recently; IDs were not supported for moderation commands (e.g. ban, kick, mute, etc).\
Although its user-friendliness may seem like just a smart way of making the bot more accessible to use, it is just a plot to take advantage of newer users. The user-friendliness is not the problem, that is simply what appeals to new users to use MEE6. Rather, it's the fact that MEE6 makes the features so easily accessible; but once a user gets into advanced stuff (e.g. reaction roles, embeds, level roles); they have to pay a premium subscription.\
This is how MEE6 is the monopolizer of Discord bots, less experienced Discord users eventually get tricked into paying for something which they can easily create with other less known bots.


### Greed
Announced on November 26th 2018, MEE6 premium was released. This is where the greed starts.\
Now, we all have to understand hosting and developing bots costs real money. Sensibly, a way to make money from the bot is necessary; especially for such a large bot like MEE6. However, MEE6 premium didn't become just a way to support the developers and gain some extra perks--it locked core features behind a paywall or only allowed for tiny amounts of use of such features. It became clear that MEE6 was being quite a tyrant with premium.\
A popular feature, XP level-up roles became premium-only. An ex-MEE6 Support Team Member states:
>  "I'm thinking in particular of the time when the XP plugin roles-rewards became paid, which frustrated a lot of regular users, even some who were already paying. In my opinion, this event marked the beginning of the bad reputation of MEE6." ~ ZRunner

In addition, premium prices got changed several times; at its epoch the premium subscription was $9.99 per month, soon after it was lowered to $4.99. Eventually, the price was raised to the current $11.95 per month. People despise these high prices to pay for features that used to be free. 
Recently, The custom bot feature was removed from MEE6's monthly subscription, and you must buy the lifetime or yearly subscription to get access to it.

Check out this comparison:
- Free Features: 6 
- Limited Features: 11
- Premium Features: 19
\* *Limited features are free features that are notably limited to only a few uses of such feature before having to pay a premium subscription.*\
\*\* *Data taken from MEE6 site.*

This data shows that over half of MEE6's features are premium, and another large fraction of them are tyrannically limited for non-paying users.

### New Staff
Recently, the MEE6 team has been going through lots of changes. One of those changes included the demotions of elder staff of the MEE6 support team. 
MEE6 has been trying to expand to a modern and professional company. The upper MEE6 development team decided they wanted to invest in paid support members, rather than volunteers. 
On August 18th 2021, the applications for "Customer Support Product Specialist" opened, which was an actual employee paid position. This was followed by another announcement for paid support hiring a few weeks later.

After the MEE6 team hired their new paid support employees, the new "Customer Support Product Specialist", Aleks, told the volunteer staff that their previous behavior over the years was unprofessional and childish. Eventually, almost all former volunteer staff were demoted from their position.\
According to some of the staff, this was "unexpected" and "not right", as they worked very hard with the limited tools they were provided for years; and they were never offered to prove themselves as useful members of this new team. Instead, they were kicked to the side and ignored.\
Not to mention, Aleks was not even previously active in the MEE6 server before he got hired. Yet, he got hired over others who applied for the position; that had been helping in support channels for years, and had more experience and were professional.\
This once again shows the unethical values of MEE6 and its leaders.

### Conclusion
MEE6 has been and continues to be a tyrant over other Discord bots. It has been monetized to gain from less informed users, and their newly formed team has disrespected previous volunteers. How long will it be until this tyrant meets its inevitable demise? Will it be one of subtle shift or rather a tyrantacy of a new force? We'll have to wait and see.

*cringes* ðŸ˜§

We all have experienced the irritating 'Nails on a Chalkboard' sound. But why is this sound so annoying? Doesn't it seem a bit random? Actually, it isn't random at all.

### Frequencies and Ear Canal
The frequencies that are most annoying to humans are between 2,000 to 5,000 hertz. It just so happens that the 'Nails on a Chalkboard' sound is between 2,000 and 4,000 hertz.
These annoying frequencies are intensified by the shape of the human ear canal. This is why certain soundsâ€”like Nails on a Chalkboardâ€”make us cringe.

### Misophonia
'Nails on a Chalkboard' can be augmented by Misophonia. Misophonia is a condition in which individuals experience deep anger and disgust when they are confronted with sounds produced by other human beings. In particular, sounds like chewing, lip-smacking, or breathing may cause intense anger and physical arousal. They may also experience similar manifestations when hearing other "annoying" sounds.

Surprisingly, Misophonia is very commonâ€”affecting approximately 15% of adults (1 in 6.5 adults). It seems to be more prevalent (or at least more stringent) in women than men, however, many suffer in silence. Some people with the condition may be denoted as grouchy or cranky.

### Conclusion
I think we are all sick of cringingâ€”so let's wrap this up.\
We find 'Nails on a Chalkboard' irritating due to sound frequencies and the shape of the human ear canal, which can be amplified by Misophonia. Now let's avoid chalkboards for a while, mmk? ðŸ™‰

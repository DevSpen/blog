A pyramid scheme is an unethical business model that asks members to recruit other members (and those new members to recruit more members) with the promise to have payments (after paying an initial fee) for enrolling others (which includes profits from other members' recruits) into the scheme, rather than fulfilling investments or sale of products. 

### MLMs vs Pyramids
A pyramid scheme is different from an MLM (multi-level-marketing) business model, although they are very similar in their own right.
MLM models are like pyramid schemes, except the company's main source of revenue and/or prime focus is not on MLM. MLM business models are legal, while pyramid schemes are not.

**MLM** - If new buyers aren't already members of the company, recruiters can sign them up and earn a percentage of the income they generate.\
**Pyramid Scheme** - Income comes from recruiting new members who must pay an entrance fee or epoch cost, which may be used to recruit new members.

If a company focuses more on recruiting tactics than sales, it may be a pyramid scheme.

### How Pyramid Schemes Work
A pyramid scheme is created when a promise is made to individuals from a company to make a profit from recruiting others to promote a product or service, after paying a fee of some sort. After a recruiter recruits another person to recruit other new members, then the original recruiter will get a percentage of the recruiters' as well as the recruiter's new member's profits, and the recruit who recruited the new recruit will also get a percentage of the new recruit's profits (and of course the company will profit). This repeats infinitely, causing new recruits (and older ones at some point) to lose money.

### The Issue
The problem with pyramid schemes is, it becomes impossible at some point for new recruits to turn a gain, as there will not be enough profits to distribute to all the recruitsâ€”the current recruiter, the recruit that recruited the new recruiter, the original recruiter, and so on. In summarized terms, at some point, the scheme gets too big, the promoter cannot raise enough money from new investors (the newer recruiters) to pay earlier investors (the older recruits), and people lose their money.

### Denouement
This is why pyramid schemes are illegal in most countries. Even though it is illegal, many fraudulent companies have found loopholes. The main issue is there is no fine line between an MLM model and a pyramid scheme, as companies can find easy ways to circumvent laws relating to pyramid schemes. Using very specific language and manipulating the scheme will most likely prevent SEC or FTC from taking any action. 

The question still remains: What will these government organizations do in the future to prevent these awful schemes? That's a question that is almost impossible to answer for now.
